# Cyber-AI-Model
AI model for detecting cyber-attacks using multiple data sources.

# Cyber AI Threat Detection Model
BEFORE THE BREACH:AI THAT SEES THE ATTACK COMING 

This project is a multi-layered AI system designed to **predict cyberattacks before they occur** by integrating **network topology**, **user behavior**, and **system configuration data** into a unified threat detection model.

---

##  Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict cyber threats using a predictive AI model.
- **Layers Combined**:
  - 🕸️ Network Topology Graph (synthetic)
  - 👤 Simulated User Behavior Logs
  - ⚙️ Simulated System Configuration Data
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Extra Layer**: LLM-Enhanced Insight Layer for human-readable alerts
